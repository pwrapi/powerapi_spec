The following list contains changes to the community Power API specification version 2.1
\begin{itemize}
  \item{PWR_ObjGetSizeOfName - New function added that allows the user to get the size of buffer required to successfully call PWR_ObjGetName for a given object.}

\end{itemize}


The following list contains changes to version 2.0 of the specification.
\begin{itemize}
  \item{PWR_StatusCreate - Added a context input parameter and clarified that statuses are cleared when used as an input to a function, therefore they should be checked prior to reuse, and caution should be taken when sharing statuses between threads.}
  \item{Groups - minor typos corrected in group function descriptions}
  \item{PWR_AppHint - Added PWR_REGION_GLOBAL_LOOP to region types, this supports runtimes that can time main compute loops}
  \item{Python - Appendix C has added python language bindings to the Power API}

\end{itemize}


The following list contains changes to version 1.4 of the specification.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Added PWR_GrpSymDifference - Symmetric difference of groups operation}
  \item{Added PWR_AttrGov enum and PWR_AttrGov Attribute to express the power governor that is being used by the operating system}
  \item{Object and Group get/set Attribute calls that returned a PWR_Status object were defined as pointers to an opaque handle, they now take the handle (not as a pointer)}
  \item{Groups - Clarified - Groups cannot contain duplicates of objects.}
  \item{Groups - Clarified - Groups can only contain objects from a single PWR_cntxt.}
  \item{Groups - Clarified - Group operations (e.g. union) can only be done on groups from the same context.}
  \item{PWR_GrpAddObj() - Changed - Attempting to add and object that is already part of a group will no longer result in an error (duplicate objects are not premitted in a group), but only no operation taking place.}
  \item{PWR_GrpRemoveObj() - Changed - attempting to remove an object that is not in a group will result in success.}
  \item{PWR_CntxtGetGrpByName() - Clarified - groups returned by this function must be functionally equivalent to those created via PWR_GrpCreate(). They must also be destroyed as a group created with PWR_GrpCreate() would be.}
  \item{PWR_AppTuningHint() - Removed - The AppHint functionality has been expanded and significantly changed. App hints must now be created/destroyed using the PWR_AppHintCreate and PWR_AppHintDestroy calls. The inputs to these calls require a hint_region_id, thereby adding suport for multiple nested hints in a single region.}
  \item{PWR_AppHintCreate() - Added - New function for creation of app hints for a region.}
  \item{PWR_AppHintDestroy() - Added - New function to destroy previously created app hints.}
  \item{PWR_AppHintStart() - Added - Once created, app hints for a given region ID can now be started (and stopped with the following new command)}
  \item{PWR_AppHintStop() - Added - Denotes the end of a region on which a application hint was provided.}
  \item{PWR_AppHintProgress() - Added - This new function call allows feedback to the Power API and underlying systems that indcates that progress in a region is being made. The time period between progress calls in combination with the progress_fraction input to this function allows a intelligent management system to determine if changes to the power of an underlying job are impacting performance and if so, by how much.}

\end{itemize}


The following list contains changes to version 1.3 of the specification.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Statistics Functions - Changed - The real-time and historic methodology (and interfaces) for accessing statistics are no longer unified as they were in previous specification versions.
                                         Interfaces for accessing historic statistics (for example from a database) are now much more direct and can be accomplished using a single call. 
                                         The interfaces for real-time statistic collection have remained largely the same but have addressed some implementation challenges. 
                                         As such they should be much more useful and easy to implement. }
  \item{PWR_OBJ_HT - Added - The PWR_OBJ_HT object type was added to respond to map more directly to how the Linux operating system views control points for the purpose of frequency modification, for example.}
  \item{PWR_ATTR_GOV - Added - The PWR_ATTR_GOV attribute type was added to map to power related governer capabilities such as those found exposed through the Linux operating system. }
\end{itemize}


The following list contains changes to version 1.2 of the specification.

\begin{itemize}
    \item{PWR_ATTR_STAT_SUM - Added - The PWR_ATTR_STAT_SUM operation was added to the PWR_AttrStat enum, intended primarily for use in PWR_StatGetReduce() as a reduction operation. }
    \item{PWR_StatGetReduce() - Changed - The description of PWR_StatGetReduce() was clarified. Arguments were added to allow the reduction operation to be specified separately from the input PWR_Stat statistic and to return the index of the object that produced the reduction result (e.g., for PWR_ATTR_STAT_MIN and PWR_ATTR_STAT_MAX operations).}
    \item{Statistics Functions - Changed - Changed return codes of PWR_StatStart, PWR_StatStop, PWR_StatClear, PWR_StatGetValue, and PWR_StatGetValues to be an 'int' (previously was PWR_Stat, which was a typo). }

    PWR_AttrAccessError structure and the order that errors are returned.}
\end{itemize}
